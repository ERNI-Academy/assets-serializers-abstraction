# Getting Started
At this point, we have to use this project like dll or directly on our production projects.

On next releases, we transform the solution into nuget. 

## Prerequisites

- [.Net 6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6)
- [c# 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-11)
